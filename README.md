# multi-factor-valuation-model
Built a multi-factor stock valuation model in Python that automates intrinsic value estimation using real-time financial data. The model integrates DCF, capital structure analysis, profitability metrics, and scoring logic to produce structured buy/fair/sell signals. I have made it Tech-Savvy by using pandas and Yfinance for data structuring and extraction.


**Methodology Used**

-*1️ Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:*
Used with the ROE context to avoid misleading signals.

-*2️ PEG Ratio*
Price-to-Earnings relative to growth.

-*3️ Free Cash Flow Yield:*
FCF / Market Cap to measure value relative to cash generation.

-*4️ Return on Equity (ROE):*
Profitability efficiency measure.

-*5️ Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):*
Revenue CAGR-based growth estimation
CAPM for the cost of equity
WACC for the discount rate
Terminal value via the Gordon Growth Model
Enterprise value adjusted to equity value

-*6️ Debt-to-Equity Ratio:*
Balance sheet risk analysis.


**Scoring Methodology & Weights**

To ensure a balanced valuation, the model assigns weights to each factor based on its reliability as a value indicator:

| Factor | Weight | Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **DCF Intrinsic Value** | **35%** | The core fundamental value based on future cash flows. |
| **Free Cash Flow Yield** | **25%** | Measures actual "cash-in-hand" relative to market cap. |
| **PEG Ratio** | **10%** | Balances valuation with projected earnings growth. |
| **Return on Equity (ROE)** | **10%** | Profitability efficiency check. |
| **Price-to-Book (P/B)** | **10%** | Asset-based valuation (adjusted for sector norms). |
| **Debt-to-Equity (D/E)** | **10%** | Risk multiplier; penalizes over-leveraged companies. |
