### Equity Valuation Engine

**A Python-based multi-factor stock valuation system that combines intrinsic valuation, peer comparison, financial quality analysis, and weighted scoring to classify stocks as undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued.**

A Python-based stock valuation engine that combines **intrinsic valuation**, **relative valuation**, and **financial quality analysis** to estimate whether a stock appears **undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued**.

This project is built to go beyond a single-ratio approach by using multiple valuation methods together, including **DCF**, **peer comparison**, **profitability metrics**, **cash flow analysis**, and **balance sheet strength**, to create a more structured and realistic view of valuation.

## Overview

Valuing a stock using only one metric can be misleading. A low P/E ratio may not mean a stock is cheap, and a high P/E ratio may not always mean it is expensive. This model attempts to solve that problem by combining several methods into one framework.

The valuation engine:

- Extracts financial data using `yfinance.`
- Performs **non-peer valuation**
- Performs **peer-based valuation**
- Evaluates **quality and financial health**
- Applies a **weighted scoring logic**
- Produces a final classification such as:
  - **Undervalued**
  - **Fairly Valued**
  - **Overvalued**
  - **Inconclusive**

## Key Features

### 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation
Uses projected future cash flows and discounts them back to present value.

- Supports **FCFE-based valuation**
- Includes **terminal growth assumptions**
- Uses a **CAPM-style discount rate**
- Allows different assumptions for **US and Indian stocks**

### 2. Relative / Peer Valuation
Compares a company against similar companies in its industry using:

- P/E Ratio
- Forward P/E
- PEG Ratio
- P/B Ratio
- EV/EBITDA
- EV/EBIT
- EV/Sales
- P/FCF

### 3. Quality Analysis
Evaluates the strength of the business using metrics such as:

- ROE
- ROA
- Operating Margin
- Net Margin
- Free Cash Flow Yield
- Debt-to-Equity
- Interest Coverage
- Current Ratio
- Asset quality indicators

### 4. Weighted Scoring System
Instead of depending on one ratio, the model assigns weights to different metrics and produces a combined view.

### 5. Industry-Aware Logic
Different industries may require different weights and interpretations. The model is designed to support:

- Industry-specific weights
- Asset-intensity checks
- Selective use of P/B for asset-heavy businesses
- Better peer relevance

## How It Works

The model follows a broad pipeline like this:

1. **Fetch company financial data**
2. **Clean and standardize the extracted data**
3. **Calculate standalone valuation metrics**
4. **Identify peer companies**
5. **Compare valuation ratios against peer medians**
6. **Evaluate business quality**
7. **Apply weighted scoring**
8. **Generate final classification**

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaronshibutho-prog/propell-valuation-engine.git
   cd propell-valuation-engine
   or
   Download the project files directly from the repository and keep them in the same folder.
   
2. **Install the required dependencies manually:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy yfinance
   
3. **Ensure all project files are in the same directory:**
   *valuator.py,*
   *yfinextractor.py,*
   *peer_allocator.py,*
   *peer_accelerator.py,*
   *industry_ticks.xlsx,*
   *industry_ticks_weighted.xlsx,*
   *industry_quality_weights.xlsx,*
   
4.**Run the main valuation script:**
    ```bash
   python valuator.py

5.**Enter the stock ticker like:**
    *NVDA*
    *MSFT*
    *AAPL*
    *TSM*
